big ups will cs

What I need to ask:
	How do presenters currently upload their shows?
		I assume they just get the file from wherever myriad saves their shows and uploads it themselves
	What is wrong with that?
		More for full clarity
	What do I need to make?
		Like am I getting the files from where they are downloaded to, or are presenters going to need to upload and add all of their data (e.g. show name, profile, etc. {this can be automated as well to a point, maybe use myriad data if they have an api?})
	Does this need to run constantly, or is it going to be like a file upload thing?
